Game of life implementation in RXJS using canvas rendering. Could probably be optimized. **No for loops**.

## Baking the cake
```shell
npm install
npm run dev # start the dev server
```

*Chrome might throw a fit and warn you about requestAnimationFrame handler violations - he's a nasty little lad*

## Deep dive
```shell
src   
â”‚
â”‚--  index.js # streams and what not
â”‚--  renderer.js # canvas rendering
â”‚--  utils.js # all of them nasty functions
â”‚--  shapes.js # custom shapes represented as lists of coords

```

### Everything is a stream
Think of the game of life as a stream `reducing` over itself. The implementation is a little more complicated in order to optimize the rendering, but you get the idea.
```shell
------x-----------------------x----------------x->
[ 0, 0, 1, 0,          [ 0, 0, 0, 0,
  0, 0, 1, 0,   --->     0, 1, 1, 1,   --->   ...
  0, 0, 1, 0,            0, 0, 0, 0,
  0, 0, 0, 0 ]           0, 0, 0, 0 ]
 ```



Oh and **no unit-tests**, sooooorry.
